# **MA-Web-App**

Web app that gathers sports data and stores data in database. More information to come.

### Things that we would like to include

### Ideas to implement

- Sports idea
- Othello

### Other overview

- Thinking about using api to call once a day then store that information in database and have our front end call back end API we create to get information from database.
- Thinking maybe using Django becuase it is in python and can be an easy thing to use with data.
